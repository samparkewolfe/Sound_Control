# Sound Control ToDos

## Holistic’s
* Make a windows version.

* Make it easier to distinguish between instruments.

#### Recorder

## Sensors
#### Multi-Colour Tracker.

#### Microbit Accelerometer
* Distribute .hex separately. (?) (planning to include a number of hex files for different purposes and platforms)

#### Microbit Pins

#### GamTrak
* Make floating window smaller.

#### Leap
* Make visualisations bigger.

#### Colour Tracker
* Make tracking colour icon larger. (done)
* Check if the mouse clicking accurate? (yes)
* Add a large visualisation of the camera.


## Sounds
#### Sample Player
* Bug On Other Machine: Won’t load folder that doesn’t explicitly have sound file types in it. (other machine being windows?)

#### Granulator
* Fixed Bug: Run shadow doesn’t go away.
* Take volume away from quick record somehow.
* Take away presets with silence.

#### Looper
* Bug: Tiles can be turned on even when tiles are “inactive” therefore If a sound file is loaded into that sample player then it will be played by quick recording. (need to test)
* Improve quick predictions better. (?)

#### Midi Mapper
* Gets confused when more than one is running. 
* Explore midi routing with GarageBand more.

#### Mixer
* Add Presets (as in audio files?)

#### FM Synth


## Models
#### Quick
* Implement some PCA. (?)
	* MnM: a Max/Msp Mapping tool.
* Implement some simple clustering.

#### Precise
* Implement some PCA. (?)
	* MnM: a Max/Msp Mapping tool.


## Samples
#### New Samples
* Sound effects & Familiar noises (should we include some folders?)

#### Animal Sounds. 

#### Apple Loops

#### Musicstems.org

#### Music Radar Ska Loops

#### Fart Samples
* I think we should only use the highest quality field recordings for these

## New Functionality
* Squeez-ables. (?)
